                        BORED APEYATCH CLUB</p>
                        <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

                <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
                <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br> possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes <br> are dope, but some are rarer than others.</p>
            <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br> hosted on IPFS. <a href=""> (See Record and Proof.)</a> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.</p>
            <p>To access members-only areas such as <a href=""> THE BATHROOM </a> , Apeholders will <br> need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

            <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It <br> contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br> any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br> expletives.</p>
            <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen <br> minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A <br> members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
            <p>We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
